Develop a program to calculate the total and individual player scores in a cricket match. 
Input would be an array with the index representing the ball number and the value representing the runs scored of that ball.

Assumptions/Tips:

    1.No Extras bowled

    2.Batsman has to be rotated after ever over

    3.Bowler can bowl any number of overs

    4.Assume Batsman 1 is on strike for the first ball.


 Below is an example:

Input : 
    [1,2,0,0,4,1,6,2,1,3];

Output:

    Total Score: 20
    Batsman 1 Score : 4 (1 + 3)
    Batsman 2 Score : 16 (2 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 1)
